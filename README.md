# ðŸ§  Frontend Quiz App

A dynamic and interactive quiz application built with React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. Test your knowledge across various frontend subjects, track your score, and enjoy a seamless, responsive experience. ðŸš€

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Installation

To get started with the Frontend Quiz App, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

âœ¨ **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Isaacayomi/frontend-quiz-app.git
```

ðŸ“¦ **Navigate to Project Directory:**

```bash
cd frontend-quiz-app
```

ðŸš€ **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Running the Application

This project uses `json-server` to simulate a backend API for quiz data.

1.  **Start the JSON Server**:
    In your terminal, run:

    ```bash
    npm run server
    # This will start the API server on http://localhost:8000
    ```

2.  **Start the Development Server**:
    In a separate terminal, run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # This will start the React development server, typically on http://localhost:5173
    ```

## Usage

Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port Vite provides).

1.  **Select a Subject**: From the home screen, choose a quiz subject (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Accessibility) to begin.
2.  **Answer Questions**: Progress through the quiz by selecting an option for each question. If you attempt to proceed without an answer, an error message will appear.
3.  **Track Progress**: The progress bar and question counter update as you answer, showing your advancement through the quiz.
4.  **Review Score**: After completing all questions, you will be directed to a score page displaying your performance.
5.  **Restart Quiz**: On the score page, you have the option to restart the quiz and choose another subject.
6.  **Toggle Theme**: Switch between light and dark modes at any time using the toggle button in the navigation bar for a personalized viewing experience.
